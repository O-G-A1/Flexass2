Since completing the course, I've <br>successfully switched careers. working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup</p>

            <p> Before joining the bootcamp, I've never <br>written a line ot code. I needed <br> some structure from professionals <br>who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former student ot theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br>that no tutorial could ever have. In <br> fact. I've often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
